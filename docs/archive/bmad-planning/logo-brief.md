# Logo Brief — Hoxtup

**Purpose:** Guide for LLM-assisted logo creation

**Status:** Logo direction selected — Pure Type V1 (Dot Accent)

---

## Brand Name

**Hoxtup** (pronounced "Hoks-tup", 2 syllables, accent on "Hox")

## Brand Personality

- Professional, calm, operational, premium-but-approachable
- An action-verb brand ("On Hoxtup cet appartement")
- Tagline: **"Run operations effortlessly"**
- Domain: Short-term rental operations management (SaaS B2B)
- Target: Property owners, agencies, professional hosts

## Visual Direction

- Modern, minimalist wordmark or lettermark
- Play on the **"X"** as a visual anchor (tech, workflow, centrality)
- Optionally incorporate an upward arrow or progression motif (efficiency, control)
- Clean, geometric construction — no hand-drawn or organic feel
- Must work at small sizes (favicon, mobile tab bar, 16px)
- Must work in single-color (for loading states, email headers, watermarks)
- Must work on both light and dark backgrounds

## Selected Logo Direction

**Chosen: Pure Type V1 — Dot Accent** (see `Propositoino de logo/propo_1.png`)

- **Concept:** Minimalist wordmark "hoxtup" in lowercase with a small terra cotta dot positioned above the "x"
- **Why selected:** Subtle, premium, memorable. Aligns perfectly with "calm by default" and "premium discret" brand tone. Works at all sizes (the dot remains visible even at favicon scale). Clean monochrome fallback (remove the dot, still reads perfectly)
- **Variations validated:**
  - Light background: Deep teal text `#264653` + terra cotta dot `#d28370` on white `#f8fafc`
  - Dark background: White text + terra cotta dot on deep teal `#264653`
  - Monochrome: Single-color deep teal or white (no dot)
  - Small sizes: Tested at wordmark scale in propo_1 thumbnails

**Complementary icon mark recommendation:** Hexagon Hub (from HTML explorations) as standalone icon for favicon/app icon. To be finalized separately if needed.

**Typography note:** The wordmark uses a sans-serif, geometric, semi-bold font. The design system uses **Outfit** for headings/display and **Inter** for body/UI — the wordmark should align with Outfit's geometric warmth

## Color Context

- **Primary brand color:** Deep teal `#264653`
- **Warm accent:** Terra cotta `#d28370`
- **Background:** Clean white `#f8fafc`
- The logo should primarily use the deep teal, with terra cotta as an optional secondary accent
- A monochrome (single-color) version is mandatory

## Typography Guidance

- Sans-serif, modern, slightly geometric
- Medium to semi-bold weight for the wordmark
- Good legibility at small sizes
- International-friendly (no decorative characters)

## Inspiration References

- **Linear** — Clean, minimal, geometric mark
- **Notion** — Simple wordmark with subtle personality
- **Stripe** — Professional, trustworthy, premium feel
- **Monday.com** — Approachable B2B without being childish

## Avoid

- Overly playful/startup-y aesthetics (no rounded bubbly fonts)
- House/building/key icons (too literal for rental management)
- Complex illustrations or mascots
- Gradients as the primary logo treatment
- Thin/light font weights (must read well on mobile)
- Generic SaaS logos (cloud, checkmark, shield)

## Deliverables Expected

1. **Primary logo** — Wordmark "hoxtup" with terra cotta dot accent on the X (horizontal)
2. **Icon only** — Hexagon Hub mark for favicon, app icon, small spaces (to be finalized)
3. **Wordmark only** — "hoxtup" with dot accent, for headers, documents
4. **Monochrome version** — Single color deep teal on white, or white on dark (no dot)

## Usage Context

- Web app header/sidebar (small, ~32px height)
- Mobile bottom nav or top bar
- Landing page hero section
- Email templates
- PDF report headers
- Social media profile images
